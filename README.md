# EasyTask

This Python-based application serves as a simple, yet effective task manager. It utilizes SQLite3 for database management and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), providing an accessible and user-friendly environment for task tracking.

## Current Features
The current version of the application supports the following functionalities:

Task Entry: Users can add tasks along with an associated level of difficulty. This allows for prioritization and effective management of tasks based on their complexities.

Add Entry: A dedicated 'Add Entry' button facilitates the insertion of new tasks into the database. With a simple click, the task and its difficulty level are stored, ready to be accessed and managed.

Delete Last Entry: The application supports deletion of tasks. The 'Delete Last Entry' button removes the most recent task from the database, allowing for easy correction of errors or removal of completed tasks.

At present, the database can handle up to 10 tasks, making it suitable for managing daily or weekly tasks effectively.

## Future Developments
This project is in its early stages and serves as a foundation for further development and experimentation with SQLite and Tkinter. Planned enhancements include, but are not limited to, the ability to manage more tasks, edit existing entries, and sort tasks based on various criteria.

## Conclusion
This application is a testament to the power of Python and its libraries, showcasing the ability to create functional and practical applications with its array of tools. It is an ongoing project, and contributions or suggestions are welcomed as I continue to expand and improve its capabilities.
